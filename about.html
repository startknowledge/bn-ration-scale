      <section>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>BN Ration Scale</strong>, a free and user-friendly online calculator designed specifically for members, veterans, and families of the Indian Defence Forces who want easy, accurate estimates of ration scales and entitlement quantities.</p>
        <p> This tool has been crafted with care to offer clarity and practicality, helping defence personnel and their loved ones better understand how ration quantities are estimated under government-approved norms.</p>
        <p>While many calculators exist, BN Ration Scale goes beyond simple forms — we focus on transparency, correctness, and usability for those who deserve precise planning tools.</p>
      </section>

        <h2>Our Mission — Empower Defence Personnel with Useful Tools</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Deployment planning</li>
          <li>Unit logistics forecasting</li>
          <li>Family provisioning</li>
          <li>Administrative requisition estimates</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Who Is This Tool For?</h2>
        <h3>1. Serving Indian Army Personnel</h3>
        <p>Whether you’re a: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sepoy (Sep)</li>
          <li>Lance Naik (LNk)</li>
          <li>Naik (Nk)</li>
          <li>Havildar (Hav)</li>
          <li>Junior Commissioned Officer (JCO)</li>
          <li>Officer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can use this tool to estimate your ration scales, quantities, and projected supplies according to regulated military norms.</p>
        <h3>2. Veterans and Ex-Servicemen</h3>
        <p>After retirement, many veterans revisit ration entitlement values for documentation, pension planning, or family provisioning. This tool gives an easy way for veterans to estimate and understand their data at a glance.</p>
        <h3>3. Family Members and Dependents</h3>
        <p>Many family members manage logistics planning or support daily ration planning for defence personnel households. This calculator gives them a trusted benchmark.</p>
        <h3>4. Logistics Officers and Unit Administrators</h3>
        <p>Officers and clerks dealing with daily supplies can use this tool to cross-verify manual calculations, or as a quick reference.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Why This Tool Matters</h2>
        <p>In official documents, ration scale norms and entitlements are buried inside references and government manuals. These resources are authentic but not always easy to read or interpret, particularly for people without administrative training.</p>
        <p>BN Ration Scale bridges that gap by transforming:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Government tables</li>
          <li>Calculated logic</li>
          <li>Supply norms</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Into a simple online form that instantly calculates your personalised ration requirements.</p>
        <p>With this tool, you will never need to juggle charts or cross-references — we do the heavy lifting so you can focus on planning and logistics.</p>

        <h2>How the Calculator Works</h2>
        <h3>Input Values</h3>
        <p>To generate your estimate, the calculator requires:</p>
        <p>These values are typical parameters used in official defence ration and entitlement evaluations.</p>
        <h3>Internal Logic</h3>
        <p>The calculator uses a defined set of formulas based on current government norms and pay commission guidelines. It calculates:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ration entitlement based on service classification</li>
          <li>Officer</li>
          <li>JCOs / Other Ranks </li>
          <li>Total entitlement results</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Accuracy and Reliability</h2>
        <p>We strive for accuracy, but it’s important to understand:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>This is an estimation tool</li>
          <li>It does not access official personnel records</li>
          <li>Results shown are approximate and for planning purposes only</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For formal documentation or official requisitions, always refer to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your unit’s administrative office</li>
          <li>Defence Supply Corps documentation</li>
