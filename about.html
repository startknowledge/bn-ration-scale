      <h2>Why This Tool Matters</h2>
      <p>In official documents, ration scale norms and entitlements are buried inside references and government manuals. These resources are authentic but not always easy to read or interpret, particularly for people without administrative training.</p>
      <p>BN Ration Scale bridges that gap by transforming:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Government tables</li>
        <li>Calculated logic</li>
        <li>Supply norms</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Into a simple online form that instantly calculates your personalised ration requirements.</p>
      <p>With this tool, you will never need to juggle charts or cross-references — we do the heavy lifting so you can focus on planning and logistics.</p>

      <h2>How the Calculator Works</h2>
      <h3>Input Values</h3>
      <p>To generate your estimate, the calculator requires:</p>
      <p>These values are typical parameters used in official defence ration and entitlement evaluations.</p>
      <h3>Internal Logic</h3>
      <p>The calculator uses a defined set of formulas based on current government norms and pay commission guidelines. It calculates:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ration entitlement based on service classification</li>
        <li>Officer</li>
        <li>JCOs / Other Ranks </li>
        <li>Total entitlement results</li>
      </ul>
